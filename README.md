# By Newbie, For Newbies
* I am a newbie. I write some newbie friendly code. I put them here for newbies as reference.
* If you have any question, feel free to open issue, including your homework/assignment/final project.
* If you think my code are pieces of sh!t, modify them and open PR.

By the way this repo is somehow in Arctic Code Vault.... :shrug:
